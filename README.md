# Taxi-Service-Demand-and-Supply-Analysis
Repo for a model that analyzes the supply ratio between the number of riders (demand) to the number of drivers (supply) available per hour.

# Overview
* The model provides an output-of-supply ratio of demand to supply of taxi services.
* Libraries such as pandas and plotly were used.
* The dataset has three columns; Drivers Active per Hour, Riders Active per Hour, Rides Completed.
* The model removes null values, analyzes demand and supply, calculates elasticity, calculates supply ratio, and visualizes supply ratio.

# Notes
* Although a specific data set is used for this model, it can be easily altered to cater to other datasets.
* Data was acquired from www.statso.io
